Well I understand the cookies. Now I need to understand the routing and working of these urls: \
@core_apps/users/urls.py How do the paths in this file tie to the paths in @config/urls.py and how do they tie to the paths in djoser and 
SOCIAL_AUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS and we also have this env variable 
REDIRECT_URIS="http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/google,http://localhost/api/v1/auth/complete/google-oauth2/"  how do the @core_apps/users/serializers.py fit in the 
picture?\
I need a good explanation of routing in django not necessarily how cookies are added to the request and response cycle. 







great can you make anki cards starting from where I asked you to explain how routing and urls work in django. When thinking of the questions bear in mind that I use anki for a long period thus the question
 must make sense independently
