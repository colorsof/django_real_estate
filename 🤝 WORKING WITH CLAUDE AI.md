🤝 WORKING WITH CLAUDE (Me!)
When to use Claude during your journey:
Sunday Night (Weekly Planning):
"Claude, I'm planning next week's learning sessions.
I'm currently on lecture [X].
Next lectures are about [topic].
Help me:
1. Identify which lectures to tackle Mon/Wed/Fri
2. What new concepts I'll encounter
3. Key questions to have ready"



Morning of Session (6am Planning):
"Claude, today I'm learning [concept] from lecture [X].
My context: [paste my-context.md OR summarize]
Today's goal: [paste goal.txt]

Help me prepare:
1. What are 3 likely points of confusion?
2. What prompts should I have ready?
3. What do I need to deeply understand vs what can I AI-assist?"


During Session (As Needed):
Use the Prompting Framework levels 1-6
This is your actual learning - Claude becomes your tutor

Evening Review (Optional):
"Claude, I just finished today's session.
Here are my notes: [paste session-notes.txt]

Help me:
1. Structure a good voiceover script
2. Identify what was most valuable to show
3. Suggest a compelling title"



Weekly Retro (Friday Evening):
