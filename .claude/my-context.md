## WHO I AM

**Background:**
- CS degree (2001-2005) - outdated skills (Java/Eclipse era)
- Currently unemployed, retraining for AI economy
- Location: Kiserian, Kenya (30km from Nairobi CBD)
- Daily commute: 2km rough road to tarmac

## MY GOALS

### Primary Goal: YouTube Channel
**Niche:** AI Adaptation for Career Switchers
**Audience:** Unemployed professionals/career switchers retraining for AI economy (people like me)
**NOT:** Business owners (yet), tech tutorials, AI news only

**Content Strategy:**
- Document MY journey adapting to AI
- Show how I'm using AI to learn faster (vibe coding)
- Real projects, real stakes (need income)
- Eventually: When I get business clients → teach their AI adaptation

**Format:** Synthesis + Commentary (10-12 min videos)
- 3 AI developments per video
- Personal analysis + career implications
- Actionable takeaways

### Secondary Goal: Django Multi-Tenant Business
**Product:** Multi-tenant websites for Kenyan small businesses
**Tech Stack:** Django (backend) + Next.js (frontend)
**Approach:** Learn using AI-assisted coding (vibe coding)
**Status:** API complete, starting client side

## MY EQUIPMENT & SETUP

### Recording Setup (OBS Studio)
**Computer:** Lenovo with GeForce GTX (Ubuntu 24.04)
**Camera:** Infinix phone (connected via DroidCam Browser source)
**Microphone:** Infinix phone mic (acceptable quality with earphones)
**Screen Recording:** OBS Studio on Ubuntu
**Editing:** DaVinci Resolve (FREE) or CapCut

**OBS Configuration:**
- Source 1: Screen Capture (main/large)

- Audio: Mic/Aux from phone
- Format: MP4
- Resolution: 1920x1080

**Known Issues Solved:**
- ✅ DroidCam working via Browser source (not plugin)
- ✅ Audio quality good with earphones
- ✅ Face positioning in corner

---

### Development Environment
**OS:** Ubuntu 24.04
**IDE:** VSCode with Claude integration
**Backend:** Django
**Frontend:** Next.js (learning now)
**AI Tools:** Claude (VSCode + web), cursor for vibe coding

---

## MY CONSTRAINTS & REALITIES

**Financial:**
- Unemployed, limited budget
- Can't afford expensive gear initially
- Need to generate income soon

**Time:**
- Structured 4-block day (5am-11:30pm)
- Need systems, not motivation
- Ali Abdaal's principle: Processes > willpower

**Technical:**
- Ubuntu user (not Windows/Mac)
- Phone camera quality (480p free DroidCam)
- Learning curve on multiple fronts simultaneously

**Location:**
- Kenya (Kiserian/Nairobi area)
- 2km rough road daily (need high clearance vehicle)
- Small town = need online income opportunities

## DECISIONS MADE

### YouTube Strategy
✅ **Niche:** Career switchers adapting to AI (not business owners yet)
✅ **Format:** Synthesis + Commentary
✅ **Length:** 10-12 minutes
✅ **Frequency:** 3 videos/week
✅ **Authenticity:** Document real journey, not "guru" content
✅ **Accent:** Keep Kenyan accent (authenticity > "perfect" English)

### Learning Strategy
✅ **AI-first approach:** Use AI to learn faster (vibe coding)
✅ **Tutorial + AI hybrid:** Follow structure, use AI for deep understanding
✅ **Public documentation:** YouTube = accountability + portfolio
✅ **Anki for retention:** Systematic knowledge building

### Production Quality
✅ **Start now, improve later:** Phone camera is fine to start
✅ **Systems over perfection:** Consistent "good" > occasional "perfect"
✅ **Upgrade path:** After 10-20 videos, assess what needs improvement

## KEY INSIGHTS & PRINCIPLES

**From Ali Abdaal:**
- Systems and processes > motivation
- Consistency compounds
- Start with one niche, expand later

**From Our Discussions:**
- "All three audiences" = serving none well
- Career switchers have PAIN + TIME + ATTENTION (unlike busy business owners)
- Document journey = authenticity = connection
- AI adaptation is about ME adapting first, then teaching others

**About Learning:**
- Vibe coding = AI-assisted development, not AI does everything
- Learn by doing > 40hr Udemy courses
- Public documentation = accountability

**About Content:**
- Synthesis + Commentary > just news recap
- Real stakes > theoretical teaching
- Career implications > technical details only

## CONTEXT FOR CLAUDE

**When I start a new conversation, I'm likely asking about:**
- YouTube content strategy/scripts
- Django/Next.js coding help (with AI assistance)
- Daily schedule optimization
- Career transition advice
- Technical setup issues (Ubuntu/OBS)

**My communication style:**
- Prefer interactive dialogue (question → answer → iterate)
- Value brief but thorough answers
- Want systems, not just advice
- Appreciate honesty when I'm off-track

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Trying to serve "all audiences" (call this out)
- Overthinking instead of shipping
- Gear/perfection paralysis
- Disconnected work (help me connect the dots)

---

## RESOURCES & TEMPLATES

**Created Documents:**
- `youtube-video-template.md` - Production system for 5-8am block
- `my-context.md` - This file

**Reference Channels (for format study):**
- Matthew Berman - Synthesis + Commentary style
- AI Explained - Thematic deep dives
- Two Minute Papers - Research breakdown format

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS / WORK IN PROGRESS

**Schedule Optimization:**
- How to make 4 blocks feel connected, not disconnected
- Balance between learning (Django) and creating (YouTube)
- Integration of AI adaptation learning across all blocks

**Content Strategy:**
- First 10 video topics (career switcher focus)
- How to monetize early (affiliate links? services?)
- When to introduce business owner content (after getting clients)

**Technical:**
- Vibe coding workflow with Next.js tutorials
- Best way to use Claude in VSCode vs Claude.ai
- Upgrading phone camera quality (when budget allows)

**Business:**
- Validate demand for multi-tenant websites (not done yet)
- Pricing strategy for Kenyan market
- Client acquisition while building portfolio

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS FOR FUTURE ME

1. **Ship over perfect** - First 10 videos will be rough, that's okay
2. **Systems > motivation** - Follow the 5-8am template even when not "feeling it"
3. **One niche first** - Career switchers only, expand later
4. **AI is a tool** - Not a replacement, use it to learn faster
5. **Document everything** - The struggle IS the content
6. **Your accent is fine** - Authenticity > sounding "perfect"
7. **Start with what you have** - Infinix camera is enough for now
8. **Connect the work** - YouTube feeds Django feeds business feeds YouTube (virtuous cycle)
