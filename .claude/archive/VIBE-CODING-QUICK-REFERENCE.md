# VIBE CODING QUICK REFERENCE
*Condensed from DAILY-VIBE-CODING-SYSTEM.md*

## THE CORE SYSTEM
**Mon-Fri: 6am-12pm (This is your JOB)**
- 6-9:30am: Learn + Code + Record (main session)
- 9:30am-12pm: Continue/Edit/Learn/Admin
- Result: 5 videos/week + steady progress

**Weekend: Rest & Plan**
- Saturday: Weekly review
- Sunday: Plan next week

## MORNING ROUTINE (6am-9:30am)

### 5:45am - Wake & Prep (15 min)
- Boot computer, coffee, open my-context.md

### 6:00am - Planning (20 min)
Create `YYYY-MM-DD-goal.txt`:
```
Course Lecture: #___ (Title: ___)
Feature Building: ___
New Concepts: ___
Success Looks Like: ___

QUESTIONS FOR CLAUDE:
1. What is [concept]? ELI5 → ELI10 → Developer
2. Why does it exist?
3. What breaks without it?
```

### 6:20am - B-Roll Setup (10 min)
- Clip 1: Context (project, course, goal.txt)
- Clip 2: Ready state (blank file, Claude open)

### 6:30am - START RECORDING
**Hit OBS record - runs entire session**

## LEARNING PHASES (6:30am-9:30am)

### Phase 1: Learn Concept (30-45 min)
1. Watch course lecture (don't code yet)
2. Ask Claude: ELI5 → ELI10 → Developer explanation
3. Understand WHY before HOW

### Phase 2: Understand Approach (15-20 min)
Ask Claude: "How would YOU build this?"
Compare to course approach later

### Phase 3: Watch Course (10-15 min)
See how instructor does it, note differences

### Phase 4: Compare (10-15 min)
Ask Claude to explain differences educationally:
- Why course chose their way
- Why Claude suggested different
- Trade-offs for LEARNER

### Phase 5: Code (60-90 min)
Type code, ask "why" constantly:
- "Why are we doing X?"
- "Walk me through the flow"
- "What did I misunderstand?"

### Phase 6: Test & Debug (20-30 min)
Make it work, understand WHY it works

### Phase 7: Commit & Reflect (10 min)
```bash
git commit -m "feat: [Feature] - [What I learned]
- Key learning: [concept mastered]
- Used Claude for [challenge]
- Lecture: #[X]"
```

Write session notes with timestamps of key moments

### 9:30am - STOP RECORDING
Save, take break. Video exists, just needs editing.

## THE PROMPTING FRAMEWORK

### Level 1: Understanding
```
"Explain [CONCEPT]:
1. Like I'm 5
2. Like I'm 10
3. Like I'm a developer

Then: Why exists? What breaks without it?"
```

### Level 2: Planning
```
"My task: [feature]
How would YOU approach this?
What are key decisions?
What's simplest for learner?"
```

### Level 3: Compare Approaches
```
"You suggested [X], course does [Y]
Explain educationally:
- Why each approach?
- Trade-offs?
- Which for LEARNER?"
```

### Level 4: Implementation
```
"Let's build [feature]
Explain what each piece does and WHY
Point out deep understanding vs boilerplate"
```

### Level 5: Debugging
```
"Error: [paste]
Code: [paste]
What did I misunderstand?
Don't just fix - help me understand"
```

### Level 6: Test Understanding
```
"Let me explain [concept] back to you:
[Your explanation]
Is this correct? What am I missing?"
```

## VIDEO EDITING (5pm-6:30pm or 9:30am-12pm)

### Footage Review (25 min)
Watch at 2x, mark moments:
- 🧠 LEARN: Asking Claude questions
- 🤔 CONFUSE: Visible confusion
- 💡 AHA: "I get it now!"
- ❌ ERROR: Code breaks
- 🔧 DEBUG: Solving with Claude
- ✅ WORKS: Feature complete

### Rough Cut (20 min)
```
[0:00-0:30] Intro - Context B-roll
[0:30-1:00] Setup - Goal
[1:00-4:00] Learn - Claude explanations
[4:00-7:00] Code - Journey + debugging
[7:00-10:00] Reflect - What learned
[10:00-10:30] Outro - Takeaways
```

### Voiceover (35 min)
Record on phone, explain what happened:
- Technical learning
- Prompting strategy
- Meta-lesson

### Polish (10 min)
Title card, export, write metadata

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Daily (Mon-Fri):**
- Clocked in at 6am? ✓
- Recorded session? ✓
- Learned something? ✓

**Weekly:**
- 5 videos published? ✓
- 30 hours worked? ✓
- Enjoying process? ✓

**Ignore for 30 days:**
- Subscriber count
- View count
- Perfect quality

## COMMON TRAPS

❌ "This session was boring" → Debugging IS content
❌ "Let me re-record" → Never re-record
❌ "Need to understand first" → Record WHILE learning
❌ "Video needs perfection" → Consistency > perfection
❌ "I'm teaching" → You're LEARNING, documenting

## THE COMMITMENT

**This is my JOB: 6am-12pm, Mon-Fri**
- 5 videos/week
- 30 hours/week
- Treat seriously
- Rest on weekends

**One work block, five outcomes:**
1. Learn Django/Next.js
2. Build multi-tenant site
3. Create YouTube content
4. Develop AI-assisted learning skill
5. Prove consistent work ethic
