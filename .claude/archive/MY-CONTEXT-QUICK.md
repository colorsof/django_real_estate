# MY CONTEXT - QUICK REFERENCE
*Condensed from my-context.md*

## WHO I AM
- CS degree (2001-2005, outdated Java/Eclipse)
- Currently unemployed, retraining for AI economy
- Location: Kiserian, Kenya
- Learning: Django (API complete), starting Next.js

## MY GOALS

### Primary: YouTube Channel
- **Niche:** Career switchers adapting to AI (people like me)
- **Format:** Document MY learning journey with AI
- **NOT:** Tutorials, guru content, business owners (yet)
- **Frequency:** 5 videos/week (Mon-Fri work days)
- **Method:** Vibe coding (AI-assisted learning)

### Secondary: Django Multi-Tenant Business
- **Product:** Websites for Kenyan small businesses
- **Stack:** Django + Next.js
- **Approach:** Learn with AI, document publicly


## MY EQUIPMENT
- **Computer:** Lenovo + GeForce GTX (Ubuntu 24.04)
- **Camera:** Infinix phone (480p DroidCam)
- **Mic:** Phone mic with earphones
- **Recording:** OBS Studio
- **Editing:** DaVinci Resolve (free)
- **Development:** VSCode + Claude

## MY CONSTRAINTS
- Unemployed, limited budget
- Need income soon
- Phone camera quality (upgrade after 20 videos)
- Learning multiple things simultaneously
- Ubuntu user (not Windows/Mac)

## KEY DECISIONS MADE

**YouTube:**
✅ Career switchers niche (not business owners yet)
✅ Document real journey (not "expert" teaching)
✅ 10-12 min videos, synthesis + commentary
✅ Keep Kenyan accent (authenticity)
✅ Start with phone camera

**Learning:**
✅ AI-first approach (vibe coding)
✅ Tutorial + AI hybrid (structure + deep understanding)
✅ Public documentation (YouTube = accountability)
✅ Anki for retention

**Production:**
✅ Systems > perfection
✅ Consistent "good" > occasional "perfect"
✅ Upgrade after 10-20 videos

## CORE PRINCIPLES

**From Ali Abdaal:**
- Systems and processes > motivation
- Consistency compounds
- Start one niche, expand later

**From Learning:**
- Vibe coding = AI-assisted, not AI does everything
- Learn by doing > long courses
- Public documentation = accountability
- Ask "why" before moving on

**About Content:**
- Document struggle (it IS the content)
- Real stakes > theory
- Career implications > just technical
- Authenticity > perfection

#

## FOR CLAUDE

**I'm likely asking about:**
- Django/Next.js help (AI-assisted)
- YouTube strategy/scripts
- Schedule optimization
- Technical setup (Ubuntu/OBS)

**My style:**
- Interactive dialogue
- Brief but thorough answers
- Want systems, not just advice
- Value honesty when off-track

**Red flags:**
- Serving "all audiences"
- Overthinking vs shipping
- Gear paralysis
- Disconnected work

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **Ship over perfect** - First 10 videos will be rough
2. **Systems > motivation** - Follow schedule regardless
3. **One niche first** - Career switchers only
4. **AI is a tool** - Use to learn faster, not replace thinking
5. **Document everything** - Struggle = content
6. **Accent is fine** - Authenticity matters
7. **Current gear enough** - Infinix works for now
8. **6am-12pm is my JOB** - Treat it professionally
